**Status:** `active` 
 
**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Kiwipay is bundled credit card merchant facility and gateway. Our goal is to make it easier and less expensive for New Zealand businesses to accept credit cards online.  Our goal is to create an online payment platform that makes it easier and cheaper for any New Zealand organisation to process credit card payments online.  Kiwipay was originally created in 2004 as Lucid Pay, a side project of Lucid Design. It was setup for a handful of bed & breakfast clients who need to take credit card payments from guests overseas. At that time, PayPal™ wasn’t available in New Zealand and the only option was to open a merchant account with a bank. This was simply not cost-effective for small businesses with infrequent, small transactions. Lucid Pay had no monthly fees and a (relatively at the time) low commission rate. It operated in closed beta with a small number of clients until 2011 when the entire platform was rebuilt from the ground and became Kiwipay.
