**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Moneta.ru is a Russian Internet payment system, established in 2005. For our users we provide deposits and withdrawals (pay-outs) on merchant websites of numerous industries like airline and other transport e-tickets, e-tickets for various events (cinema, concerts, etc.), utility payments, online trading, gaming, social networks, etc. Gaming has always been a major share in our portfolio and now Moneta successfully processes payments for most renowned gaming companies.  Our perfect management of this historically risky type of transactions is due to the fact that Moneta first appeared as a dedicated payment mechanism for Russia in the Swedish WebDollar and has been the core of big gaming and non-gaming endeavors under the same ownership ever since. Another main area of business for Moneta is e-ticketing and travel and up to date Moneta has the biggest share in processing alternative payments for airlines in Russia.
