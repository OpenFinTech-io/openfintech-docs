: [EN]  Ewire offers customers simple and fast payment solutions in response to the demand from private consumers and commercial enterprises for technical and commercial solutions. We operate on a constantly changing market.  With a solid background of experience in internet trading and using the latest technologies and security principles, we will continue to launch innovative new electronic payment options.   In 2011 Ewire became an electronic money institution (ELMI). This means that we will be subject to even more security requirements, which we are already well-equipped to meet.  We select our suppliers and cooperative partners with care and, by dint of our membership of the Danish Distance Selling and E-business Association, we maintain a close dialogue with other players on our market so that we can work together in the interests of the internet-based marketplace of the future.
