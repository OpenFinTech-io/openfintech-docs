**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Mobipaid is a payment technology solution offering ecommerce transactions in a secure yet mobile setting. We are bridging the gap between traditional ecommerce payments and POS; between 'card not present'​ and 'card present'​ payments. Mobipaid can save on hardware costs for POS users as it can make ecommerce merchants more flexible and secure in taking card payments.  To operate the service the merchant and customer require only a device capable of connecting to the internet. The merchant pays only when he/she uses the service; the customer uses it for free. Merchants can use with their existing MID or get a Mobipaid issued one. This is a cloud-based service and there is no customer requirement to download an app or register card details. The merchants 'request'​ payment by sending customers an email or text message (SMS). Included in the payment request is a URL link to a secure PCI DSS Level 1 gateway. Customers follow the URL and pay!
