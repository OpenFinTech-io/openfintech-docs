**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Coda Payments is a carrier billing provider that helps customers in Southeast Asia use their mobile accounts to buy digital content on the web, mobile web and in-app. We operate a platform, on one side establishing direct IP-based connections and commercial agreements to mobile telcos, and in turn providing a simple set of API's to app developers, game publishers, and digital content providers that want to collect payment from customers. Telcos love Coda because we help them to generate net-new, profitable revenues and reduce churn. Digital content providers love Coda because we help them monetize - at reasonable rates - in countries where card penetration is low, but most every customer has a mobile account.
