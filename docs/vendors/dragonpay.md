: [EN]  Dragonpay is an alternative online payment option which provides greater security and convenience than traditional credit cards. By utilizing the Philippine bank network and non-traditional outlets like convenience stores, business centers, remittance centers and pawnshops,  Dragonpay provides a greater reach to your potential market. Dragonpay provides an alternative channel for purchasing goods or services from the Internet.  We allow buyers and sellers to conduct e-commerce without the use of traditional credit cards or PayPal, which have very low penetration in developing countries such as the Philippines. Instead, buyers can pay for their purchases through Online Banking and Over-the-Counter (OTC) Banking. Online Banking allows anybody with Internet banking access to a local bank account, to make a payment that is debited against that account in real-time.
