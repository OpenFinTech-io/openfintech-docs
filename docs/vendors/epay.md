**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  ePay was established in 2001 as four young internet entrepreneurs decided to form a new payment solution for online businesses. Back then, the industry was still in its infancy and no one – not even the big suppliers – had more than a few years of experience with online payments.       More than 10 years later, the four founders are still heading the company, and in the meantime the firm has grown steadily, expanded the staff, moved to the waterfront in Aalborg, and set up an office in Copenhagen.      Today, ePay is one of the largest payment service providers in the Nordic region. Our long-standing experience with online payments makes us a valuable business partner to both small and independent webshop owners and large international companies.
