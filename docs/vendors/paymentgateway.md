**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Payment Gateway offers a wide range of Payment processing & POS solutions to businesses across UK & EU. We have a strong team of industry experienced experts who not only provide advise but also help in generating revenue and making sure that our clients are making profit. Incorporated in February 2012, we started talking to a number of our strategic partners in helping us give our clients the best possible product and at the most cost effective prices. Starting as a POS service provider for different Businesses, we managed to secure strong relationships over the years and developed our own Payment Gateway. Linked with almost 8 - 10 Acquiring banks in EU, we became only business in UK to have such relationships plus generating revenue for different clients via cross border partner agreements. This gave us an edge on other ISO's and Payment processing businesses as we moved closer to SEPA regions.Â
