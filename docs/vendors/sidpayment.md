**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  SID Instant EFT was launched in 2007 to offer a secure online payment alternative to credit card, a service which remains greatly lacking in the South African e-commerce market. Many South African consumers prefer SID to credit card because it allows them to complete their online purchases without drawing on credit. In order to avoid lost sales and to ensure optimal ease of payment across all devices, SID comes highly recommended to South African merchants.   SID Instant EFT Benefits: •  Increase your online and mobile sales. •  Reduce costs with significantly lower processing fees. •  Eliminate fraud and chargebacks that are often associated with credit card. •  Reduce risk as SID payments are irreversible and 100% guaranteed. •  Receive payment directly into your bank account (no e-commerce account required). •  Offer optimal security via your customers’ trusted Internet Banking.
