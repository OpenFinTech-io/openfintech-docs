**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Caledon Computer Systems Inc. was established in 1983 as a hardware supplier and software developer during the incubation years of the information technology industry. Towards the early 1990â€™s, the potentially widespread adoption of the Internet presented an intriguing opportunity for the merchant industry regarding electronic payment processing and in 1997, the Caledon Card Services division was officially created. Soon after this we developed a high speed batch based payment processing system and subsequently processed Canada's first web originated credit card transaction. Following the tremendous adoption and expansion of the Internet for business purposes, it became clear that the future of Caledon would reside in the payment processing industry. In early 2005, following an inherent commitment to innovation, Caledon once again diversified our already extensive product offering by entering the merchant account business as an Independent Sales Organization and Merchant Services Provi
