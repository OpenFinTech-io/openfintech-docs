**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Transact24 Limited is incorporated with its Head Office in Hong Kong with operations, technical and support centers in Hong Kong, Zuhai (China), South Africa and Singapore. Regional registered satellite offices are located in Australia, Austria, the UK ,Indonesia, Macau and the USA. Established in 2006, the company was formed by a Swedish Venture Capital entity and staff with Hong Kong as its chosen domicile to capture the emerging Chinese online market. Staff compliment is primarily South African and Chinese and the focus of the business is to become the Internet Payment Service Provider (iPSP) of choice for the emerging markets in Asia and the Southern hemisphere. Strategic alliances with unique iPSP operators soon culminated in an abundance of services that are made available to merchants worldwide via a single API integration. These services include inter alia Ukash, Entropay, Envoy and China Union Pay, the latter specifically for the Chinese market. Transact24 Limited soon recognized the Remittance Market as one of the key growth areas in South East Asia and Africa. Numerous strategic alliances were formed with the likes of Envoy and US ACH service providers to tap into the lucrative Chinese and Philippine Remittance Markets. A further investment in infrastructure and people brought about T24 Global Issuance (T24GI) in 2009. The need for a bespoke prepaid Credit Card in the defined emerging markets landed T24GI with two large strategic card issuing projects in South Africa and South East Asia. Transact24 Limited incorporated a Call Center operation to support its Merchants and the Card Projects. This 24x7x365 support center also acts as an independent support center for international iPSPâ??s and their merchants. Transact24 Limited has launched Ukash â?? www.ukashchina.com in a unique sole joint venture in China during November 2009. The project took 18 months from conception to final launch and is specifically aimed at the Remittance Market to offer merchants alternative payment options in China. The Future Transact24 Limited is similarly expanding its footprint in Southern Africa with identified projects in the Card Issuing space and with new acquiring opportunities outside of the well-known South African banking arena. Similar projects have been identified in South America and these opportunities will be commissioned in 2011. Transact24 Limited is in process of launching its own branded prepaid Credit Card for markets in South East Asia, Africa and South America. Launch dates and details will be available in 1st Quarter 2011.
