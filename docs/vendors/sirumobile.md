**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Siru Mobile is an innovative tech startup with an international company structure founded in 2011. It all started as a result of a simple observation: the mobile landscape is evolving rapidly and the attitudes towards a mobile lifestyle are changing. We wanted to fill this new gap in the market, and enable mobile payment alternatives for our customers. From this observation we created the vision for the cloud based payment experience and the development of Siru Mobileâ€™s platform to support it.
