**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  We keep developing our system, always bearing in mind what the Turkish players need and prefer. Each of our payment option has a special, different feature.  For example, there is no-fraud in credit card transactions. GPay accepts all  responsibility for the payments via credit card. Plus, we made agreements with all the national banks, so the users will get special bonuses with each payment and we offer up to 12 instalments. Users can save their preferred credit card in the GPay account, due to our innovative and secure module. It is an easy and fast to use option, because you don't need to enter your credit card details again. Also, you won’t have to deal with each bank individually, because GPay gathers them all into one place.  On top, we issue our own e-pins, which are sold over more than 100 websites and through our 15.000 partner physical payment points. E-Pins are checked
