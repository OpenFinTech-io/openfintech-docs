**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  Cardsave was formed in 1995 by an independent retailer frustrated by the high costs of credit and debit card processing available for his business, compared to those offered to the large multiples. In order to negotiate lower rates he needed to drastically increase his buying power, and this meant joining forces with others in the same position. This was the birth of Cardsave, a unique buying group dedicated to providing competitive business services to the small business sector.  Over the last 15 years we have supported our merchants through a range of payment industry developments.From the early migration of “zip-zap” payments to electronic transactions, the deployment of secure Chip & PIN payment devices to the more recent dramatic expansion in the use of cards to take online payments we have helped merchants every step of the way.
