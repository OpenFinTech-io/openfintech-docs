: [EN]  VirtualXS provides credit card billing and various other payment methods under the name VXSBill. We can clear all Mastercard, VISA, Maestro, Ideal and Sofort transactions and also offer phone billing. All against very competitive rates.  We are NOT a 3rd party billing company, instead we function as a Payment Service Provider (PSP) for banks. We can assist you in acquiring merchant accounts with those banks allowing you to handle online transactions through our platform. We are specialised in, but surely not limited to, high risk processing. This specific market needs a different kind of approach related to chargeback and retrieval handling and fraud management. Our knowledge gained over the years in this area is beneficial for all merchants.
