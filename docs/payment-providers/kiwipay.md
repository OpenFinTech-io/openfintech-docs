: [EN] Payment Orchestration Platform - What is KiwiPay? In a nutshell, kiwipay is a payment method that is similar to PayPal, but a little more secure. When you use Kiwipay, your credit card number and billing information are not stored on their servers. Instead, they are encrypted and sent directly to the merchant. Moreover, you'll receive immediate email notification of your Transaction, including the outcome and the receipt. It's also important to print these emails for your records. Kiwipay was created by Galen King, a Nelson entrepreneur and designer who founded Lucid Design. The company has offices in the Bridge Street Collective, a shared workspace for creative professionals. He set up Kiwipay as a side project of his design business. However, he subsequently changed the name. The company's registered office address is 1105, Ashoka Estate 24, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, Central Delhi - 110001, India. After acquiring Meal Temple Group in 2020, KiwiGo evolved into a super app, offering 10 services to millions of users in Southeast Asia. Last year, KiwiPay announced plans to expand its services to seven other countries. The company signed an agreement with the Laos Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, and Development Bank to provide cashless payment channels to visitors of Laos. The new agreement paves the way for KiwiPay's global expansion.
